					<h2>About me<h2>
				</header>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>For the past 10 years I have been in retail management and customer service. I have always had a passion and curiosity for information technology and computers. At the beginning of this year I decided to make a change. I really wanted to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone. I started to research different areas in IT and fell into many hours of coding tutorials. It was then that I realized how much I love the craft of programming. I think its amazing what one can build that can solve many problems facing society today and that is something I want to be part of.</span>

					<h2>Experience<h2>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>I am a graduate from the Front End Engineering program at The Iron Yard. I have a degree in International Business. My experience in management gives me the unique ability to remain flexible and open minded on a dynamic team to quickly reach solutions. My time at The Iron Yard gives me the unique ability to break down problems systematically and quickly learn different tools, libraries and frameworks to reach solutions in a constantly changing environment. The projects below will show my progression from day one to a full stack application.</span>
